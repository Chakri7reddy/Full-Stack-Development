# Product Data Visualization

## Overview

This web application allows users to input product data, such as product name, price, and rating. The data is dynamically displayed in bar graphs, which can be sorted based on price or rating. The graphs are updated in real-time as new data is added.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS styling for the page and charts.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript code handling the functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Input Data**:
   - Enter the product name, price, and rating into the provided input fields.
   - Click the "Add Product" button to add the product to the charts.

2. **Sort Data**:
   - Click "Sort by Price" to sort the price chart in descending order of prices.
   - Click "Sort by Rating" to sort the rating chart in descending order of ratings.

3. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - As new data is added, the charts will automatically update to reflect the changes.

## Development Notes

- The bar graphs are visually represented using simple HTML and CSS without external libraries.
- Sorting functionality is implemented using JavaScript array methods.
- The charts dynamically update using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
